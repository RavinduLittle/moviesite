            <h2>  Black Adam  </h2>
            <p>Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, and featuring a remarkable lead performance by Dwayne Johnson, 
                the spiky and majestic "Black Adam" is one of the best DC superhero films to date. This tale of a gloomy,
                seemingly malevolent god who reappears in a long-occupied Middle Eastern nation rejects most of the choices that bland-ify even the good entries in the genre.
                 For its first third, it presents its title character—a champion who challenged a despotic king thousands of years earlier—as a frightening and unknowable 
                force with a bottomless appetite for destruction.
                Known by his ancient moniker Teth-Adam, his reemergence from a desert tomb proves both a miracle and a curse for people
                who prayed for someone to defend them against corporate-mercenary thugs who have oppressed them for decades and strip-mined their land. </p>
