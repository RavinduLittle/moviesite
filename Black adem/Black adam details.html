    <p>Black Adam is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics.
         Created by Otto Binder and C. C. Beck, the character is the archenemy of the superhero Shazam (formerly known as Captain Marvel).
         Black Adam first appeared in Marvel Family #1 (December 1945).
        The character's original design was based on the Egyptian prince who is chosen by the Wizard Shazam to be his champion, but later on,
         Black Adam became an antihero, sometimes depicted as an ally and even a member of the Justice Society of America.

         In the comics, Black Adam is an ancient Egyptian prince who is chosen by the Wizard Shazam to be his champion,
         but becomes corrupted by power and uses his abilities for evil. He is eventually defeated and imprisoned, 
         but is later freed in the modern day and becomes a recurring villain for Shazam and the Justice Society of America.
        Black Adam is often portrayed as being superhumanly strong and fast, with the ability to fly, shoot lightning bolts, and possess near-immortality.
        
        In recent years, there have been plans for a standalone Black Adam film, with Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson announced to play the title role.
        The movie is set to be release on December 22, 2022</p>
